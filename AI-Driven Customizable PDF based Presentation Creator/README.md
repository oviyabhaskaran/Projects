# AI-Driven PDF Content Presentation Builder

This project leverages advanced AI capabilities to streamline the process of converting PDF content into professional PowerPoint presentations. It combines automated content extraction, AI-driven content organization, and customizable slide generation to deliver highly engaging and tailored presentations based on user-defined inputs.

## Overview

The AI-Driven PDF Content Presentation Builder is designed to simplify the creation of PowerPoint presentations by automating the extraction and processing of PDF content. By utilizing the Llama 3 model, the system efficiently organizes the extracted information and dynamically generates slides with relevant titles and content. The project also includes features for inserting images and charts, ensuring visually enhanced and customizable presentations.

## Key Features

- **Automated PDF Content Extraction and Chunking**  
  The system automatically extracts and chunks content from uploaded PDFs, ensuring precise segmentation for further processing.

- **AI-Powered Content Organization**  
  Powered by the Llama 3 deployed model, the extracted content is intelligently organized and assigned to slides based on user-defined titles.

- **Dynamic Presentation Generation**  
  Automatically creates PowerPoint slides with user-provided titles and fills slide bodies with relevant, AI-extracted content from the PDF.

- **Customizable Visual Enhancements**  
  Enables users to insert images and charts into specific slides, offering flexibility and enhancing the presentation's visual appeal.

- **Streamlined User Workflow**  
  A user-friendly process ensures a seamless workflow from PDF upload to final PowerPoint generation.

## How It Works

1. **PDF Upload and Content Extraction**  
   Users upload a PDF document, and the system extracts its content into organized chunks.

2. **AI Processing with Llama 3**  
   The extracted content is processed through the Llama 3 model to generate contextually relevant data.

3. **User-Defined Slide Titles**  
   Users provide slide titles, and the system assigns appropriate content to each title.

4. **Dynamic Slide Generation**  
   The system generates PowerPoint slides dynamically, auto-populating them with titles, text, images, and charts.

5. **Customization Options**  
   Users can further enhance slides by adding charts or images to specific slides.
