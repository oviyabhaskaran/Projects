## Invoice Processing Bot - Streamlit UI with Mistral AI

A smart invoice processing assistant that extracts, validates, and summarizes invoices using LLM agents, with Pymupdf for proper PDFs and built-in Mistral OCR for scanned or handwritten PDFs. Built with Streamlit UI and integrated with Mistral AI.

## Mistral AI

Mistral AI API provides a seamless way for developers to integrate Mistral's state-of-the-art models into their applications and production workflows with just a few lines of code. The Mistral models allows you to chat with a model that has been fine-tuned to follow instructions and respond to natural language prompts. A prompt is the input that you provide to the Mistral model. It can come in various forms, such as asking a question, giving an instruction, or providing a few examples of the task you want the model to perform. Based on the prompt, the Mistral model generates a text output as a response.
