## Overview
The News Articles Segmentation System is an innovative solution designed to segment news articles from images using advanced OCR techniques and YOLO-based object detection. This system preprocesses image layouts to identify and isolate article sections accurately. By integrating AWS S3 for secure image handling and OpenCV for layout structure analysis, the tool ensures efficient segmentation. A FastAPI endpoint facilitates concurrent processing, while robust logging mechanisms track API requests and manage errors effectively. This project streamlines the extraction and segmentation of articles, making it ideal for media and data analysis applications.
