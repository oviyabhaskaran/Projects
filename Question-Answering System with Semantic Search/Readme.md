## Overview

The **Question-Answering System** with Semantic Search enables precise retrieval and analysis of document content through semantic search. It combines Pinecone for vector indexing, OpenAI embeddings for understanding, and LangChain QA with **GPT-3.5-turbo** for generating accurate, context-aware answers. A FastAPI endpoint provides seamless interaction with metadata-enriched responses.

## Key Features

- **Semantic Search Implementation**: Developed a system to enable retrieval of relevant document content through semantic search.
- **Vector Index Creation**: Built an efficient document retrieval mechanism using Pinecone and OpenAI embeddings.
- **API Integration**: Implemented a FastAPI endpoint to filter documents via similarity search and provide metadata-enriched responses.
- **Answer Generation**: Integrated LangChain QA chain with GPT-3.5-turbo to deliver precise and context-aware answers.
