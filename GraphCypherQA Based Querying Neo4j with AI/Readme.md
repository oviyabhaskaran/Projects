## Overview
The **GraphCypher Question Answering System** is designed to streamline interactions with graph databases, specifically **Neo4j**, by combining the power of Cypher queries and AI-driven code generation. This project enables efficient data retrieval and dynamic exploration of graph-based datasets. By leveraging **GPT-3.5-turbo**, it facilitates the creation of Python scripts for tasks such as visualizing graph data and performing advanced analytics, making it a versatile tool for developers and data analysts working with **graph databases**.

## Key Features

- **GraphCypherQAChain Pipeline**: Developed a pipeline to query Neo4j and extract data for efficient code generation.
- **Cypher Query Utilization**: Designed dynamic retrieval of node properties using Cypher queries combined with PromptTemplate for adaptable query generation.
- **GPT-3.5-turbo Integration**: Leveraged the model to produce Python code for tasks such as graph data visualizations and other analytical purposes.
