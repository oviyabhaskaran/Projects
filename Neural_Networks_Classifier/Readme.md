# Breast Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

This project implements a **deep learning neural network classifier** to distinguish between **malignant** and **benign** breast cancer cases.  

The pipeline includes **EDA**, **data visualization**, and training a neural network model for accurate classification.

## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations to understand data distribution.
- Preprocessing and normalization of breast cancer dataset.
- Deep learning neural network model for binary classification.
- Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
